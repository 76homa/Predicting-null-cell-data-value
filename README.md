# NULL cells-pridicting value
When there are null cells in the dataset that indicate missing data, it is necessary to replace the null cells with values for data analysis prediction, and modeling. As a result, null cells can be replaced with one of the following:
mean, median, or mode
zero number
The data value of the previous or next cell
Predict the value of that cell
etc
In this code, we describe the fourth method, i.e. predicting the cell with null value.
